Wanna compile your Lua script into binary in order to protect the source code ?
Easy ! Go to the "lua" folder, there is an executable called "luac.exe".

If you don't see a "compile.bat" file, you just have to create a new text file in the same folder, and put that :

luac.exe -o luaCompiled.lua luaSource.lua

Replace "luaCompiled.lua" to the file output name and "luaSource.lua" to the script's name.

Save the text file to compile.bat and run it.

Then you can put that into the lua/global folder, it will run like a normal source code.

Enjoy !
