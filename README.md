*CS Mini Projects*
================================

Here is collection of the various small projects that I undertook in order to learn the various features and programming paradigm of each language. Larger projects are stored in separate repositories.

Info
================================

Folders are organized by the IDE and/or language that they correspond to:

Wing IDE = Python
SICP = TeX / LaTeX / LyX
RStudio = R

and the rest of the folders have names representing their language.
